    <h2>Digital Dawn</h2>
    <div class="poem">A
        Pixels awaken<br>
        Code flows like morning dew<br>
        A new day begins
    </div>
    <p>This haiku was inspired by my love for technology and the constant evolution of the digital world.</p>

    <h2>My personal interests</h2>
    <p>One of my greatest passions is programming. I find immense satisfaction in solving complex problems and creating efficient algorithms. The process of turning abstract ideas into functional code is both challenging and rewarding. I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, as I believe these fields have the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives.</p>
    <p>Another interest of mine is photography. I love capturing moments and scenes that others might overlook. There's something magical about freezing a split second in time and preserving it forever. I enjoy experimenting with different techniques, from long exposures to macro photography, always striving to improve my skills and develop my unique style.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I'm deeply fascinated by astronomy. The vastness of the universe and the mysteries it holds never cease to amaze me. I often spend nights stargazing, trying to identify constellations and planets. Learning about new discoveries in space exploration and astrophysics is incredibly exciting, and it constantly reminds me of how much there is yet to learn about our cosmos.</p>
