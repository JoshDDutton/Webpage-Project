    <h2>The Cold Truth</h2>
    <div class="poem">A
        A man with no path<br>
        Walks roads with no end in sight<br>
        Refridgerator
    </div>
    <p>This haiku is an insight into my personal philosophy and the fact that the word "refridgerator" has five syllables.</p>

    <h2>My personal interests</h2>
    <p>I love to make music. My family comes from a long line of bluegrass musicians, so the learning and playing of instruments was a big part of my upbringing. My dad taught me the drums when I was just 5 years old, and from there I learned the piano, the bass, and finally the guitar. I currently play the keys in a local band called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3hZn3nUuf0KoUA4XQubzQN">Homephone</a>. We've opened for bands like The Strokes and Vampire Weekend, and we hope to have even more on the horizon. </p>
    <p>I also love retro technology and equipment. I collect far too many CRT televisions and vintage synthesizers than my small apartment can handle, but I love it anyways. I also enjoy picking up busted Playstation 2s and Wiis on Facebook Marketplace and fixing them up to give to friends to spread my philosophy that no one should be dumping hundreds of dollars on the newest consoles and the newest games before they've even played any of these classic amazing games that they can get up and running for like 30 bucks through Ebay.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I'm very passionate about the economy. Trust me, I'm not you're steriotypical stock market crypto pumping finance bro, I'm more fascinated by its fluctuation and the world events that can have an effect on seemingly the most random companies. I love reading about how in 2020 when everyone started using Zoom for their classes and their bussinesses, the stock increase was so dramatic that even the company ZOOM corporation, a completely unrelated media company, saw incredible evaluations just for having a similar name. I find a lot of these reports to be a humurous insight into how much our market can fluxuate and how trigger happy wall street brokers can be. This knowledge will also hopefully help me come up with stable investment plans of my own through ROTH IRAs or the SMP 500 to ensure a better future for me and my family.  </p>
